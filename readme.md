# Quick Start Scripts

The scripts in here (currently script) I use whenever I need to create a new server. Since I just create Ubuntu 22.04 VMs on Digital Ocean and Vultr for my sites, it's all I currently have focused on. However I have plans to restructure this whole repo to have full scripts for literally everything. For now, this is the layout, until I manage to soon switch it to more. This will be all bash scripts until I end up deciding to just make the quick start scripts using something like C or Go.

## Install Script

The install script doesn't require to you install ANYTHING yourself, except maybe git if you want to just clone the repo (Although, it does install git if you just copy and paste the current script).

The Script only works on Ubuntu 22.04 for now.
